Run make install to create virtual environment and install dependencies

To execute script for all/some accounts:

```
$ export accounts=(acc1 acc2 accn)
$ for account in ${accounts[@]}; do awsume $account; .venv/bin/python3 awsec.py; done
```

N.B.
- You need ''awsume''
- acc1..accn are the profiles exactly as in .aws/config
